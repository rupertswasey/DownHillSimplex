This solution file was made with Visual Studio 2012 using C#

There are 3 projects in this solution. One is the main downhill simplex project 
and one contains the unit and integration tests. The third, called 'RunDownHillSimplex' is
a Console App project where there is an example of creating and running a DownHillSimplex 
object and viewing the result.
